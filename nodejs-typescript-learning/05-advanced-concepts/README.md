# 5. Advanced Concepts

Now that you have a solid foundation, let's explore some more advanced (and practical) concepts that you'll frequently encounter when building Node.js applications.

## Topics Covered

-   **Middleware in Express**: Learn how to use middleware for tasks like logging, authentication, and more.
    -   `01-middleware`
-   **Error Handling**: Implement a centralized error-handling mechanism for your API.
    -   `02-error-handling`
-   **Connecting to a Database**: Learn the basics of connecting your Node.js application to a database. We'll use a simple in-memory database for this example, but the principles apply to real databases like PostgreSQL or MongoDB.
    -   `03-database-integration`

These topics are crucial for building robust, scalable, and maintainable applications.
