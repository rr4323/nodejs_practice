# 2. Node.js Fundamentals

This section covers the fundamental concepts of Node.js. We will explore how to work with modules, interact with the file system, and handle asynchronous operations.

## Topics Covered

1. **Modules**
   - Learn how to use Node.js modules to organize your code
   - Understand `require()` and `module.exports`
   - [Go to Module Examples](./01-modules/README.md)

2. **File System (fs) Module**
   - Read and write files asynchronously and synchronously
   - Work with directories and file metadata
   - Handle file operations with callbacks and Promises
   - [Go to File System Examples](./02-file-system/README.md)

3. **Asynchronous Programming** (Upcoming)
   - Callbacks, Promises, and async/await
   - Error handling in asynchronous code
   - `03-async-programming`

4. **The HTTP Module** (Upcoming)
   - Create HTTP servers and clients
   - Handle requests and responses
   - `04-http-module`

## Getting Started

1. Navigate to any topic directory
2. Read the README.md for explanations
3. Run the example files with Node.js:
   ```bash
   node filename.js
   ```

## Prerequisites

- Node.js installed (v14+ recommended)
- Basic JavaScript knowledge
- Terminal/Command Prompt
