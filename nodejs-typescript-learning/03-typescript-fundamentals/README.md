# 3. TypeScript Fundamentals

Welcome to the TypeScript fundamentals section! Here, you will learn the core concepts of TypeScript and how it enhances JavaScript development for Node.js applications.

## Why TypeScript?

TypeScript is a strongly typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. It brings several powerful features to JavaScript development:

- **Static Typing**: Catch errors during development before they reach production
- **Enhanced IDE Support**: Better autocompletion, code navigation, and refactoring tools
- **Improved Code Quality**: Type annotations serve as documentation and prevent common bugs
- **Modern JavaScript Features**: Use the latest ECMAScript features while maintaining compatibility
- **Better Collaboration**: Clear contracts between different parts of your application
- **Easier Maintenance**: Safer refactoring and better code organization

## Learning Path

This guide is structured to take you from TypeScript basics to advanced concepts:

1. **Getting Started**
   - Setting up a TypeScript project (`01-setup`)
   - Configuring TypeScript with `tsconfig.json`

2. **Core Types** (`02-basic-types`)
   - Primitive types: `string`, `number`, `boolean`
   - Arrays, Tuples, Enums
   - Special types: `any`, `unknown`, `never`
   - Type assertions and type guards

3. **Object-Oriented Programming** (`03-interfaces-classes`)
   - Interfaces and type aliases
   - Classes and inheritance
   - Access modifiers and readonly properties
   - Abstract classes and methods

4. **Advanced Types** (`04-advanced-types`)
   - Union and intersection types
   - Generics
   - Utility types
   - Mapped and conditional types

5. **Functions** (`05-functions`)
   - Function types
   - Optional and default parameters
   - Rest parameters and function overloading

6. **Modules and Namespaces** (`06-modules-namespaces`)
   - ES Modules
   - Namespaces
   - Module resolution

7. **TypeScript with Node.js** (`07-nodejs-integration`)
   - Type definitions with `@types`
   - Working with Express.js
   - Debugging TypeScript in Node.js

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of JavaScript (ES6+)
- Node.js installed on your system
- A code editor with TypeScript support (VS Code recommended)

Let's begin by setting up your first TypeScript project in the `01-setup` directory!
