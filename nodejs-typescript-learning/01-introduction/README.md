# 1. Introduction to Node.js and TypeScript

This section provides a high-level overview of Node.js and TypeScript.

## What is Node.js?

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It allows you to run JavaScript on the server-side, enabling you to build fast and scalable network applications. Key features include:

-   **Asynchronous and Event-Driven**: Most APIs in Node.js are non-blocking, which means Node.js can handle many connections concurrently.
-   **Single-Threaded**: Node.js uses a single-threaded model with an event loop, which simplifies programming and avoids the complexities of multi-threading.
-   **NPM (Node Package Manager)**: Node.js has a rich ecosystem of open-source libraries and tools available through npm, the default package manager.

## What is TypeScript?

TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static types. It is developed and maintained by Microsoft. Key benefits of using TypeScript include:

-   **Static Typing**: Catch errors early in development by defining types for your variables, functions, and objects.
-   **Improved Code Quality and Readability**: Types make your code easier to understand and maintain.
-   **Modern JavaScript Features**: TypeScript supports the latest JavaScript features and compiles them down to a version of JavaScript that can run in any browser or Node.js environment.

## Why use Node.js with TypeScript?

Combining Node.js with TypeScript gives you the best of both worlds:

-   **Scalability of Node.js**: Build high-performance applications that can handle a large number of concurrent connections.
-   **Safety and maintainability of TypeScript**: Write more robust and error-free code that is easier to refactor and scale.
